I was asked to solve this assignment when applied for a position of Software Engineer in June 2021. The assignment
consists of creating two C programming based applications. As I had two more assignments (one in C and the other in
C++(coming soon)) to solve at the same time during that time, I prioritized the other two assignments due to more
attractive job offers (and fortunately was hired for one of them before the other). Due to low priority, I solved only
one of the two tasks. This is my solution (code) and report for the task.
